# mnist-handwritten-digit

The MNIST dataset is an acronym that stands for the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology dataset.

It is a dataset of 60,000 small square 28Ã—28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9.

The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively.

Added a tkinter GUI, which will populate a writing canvas, where a digit between 0 - 9 can be written (in live) and the predicted output digit is shown with % of accuracy.
